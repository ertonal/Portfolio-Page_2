These are the following steps i took:

Note: when i do git remote always use the SSH key because the hhtp makes me enter the username and password, and I don’t know mine

Also, don’t add a READme file from the github (where it says add readme) but instead make it yourself in the vs code and push it similar to how you push index.html css etc

Also, when adding a change, use git add -A to add everything (don’t use git add .) as this might not add everything

Homework

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

So, need to see:

1) The name, avatar / or recent photo and links to sections about them (example: their work , contact me , etc

2) When you click one of the links in the navigation, it scrolls to that part of the page

3) When you click on the link to the section about my their work, it scrolls to a section with titled images of the depevelopers applications

4) when presented with the developer’s first application, then that application mage should be larger in size than the others

5) when you click on the images of the applications, you’re taken to that deployed application

6) when resize the page/or view it on site with various screens, then presented with a responsive layout that adaps to the viewport (so media queries)

Similar to this example:

This is the work part continued:

And the last part, with the about me section:
