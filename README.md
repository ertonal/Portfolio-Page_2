# Website Portfolio

## Description

Built a portfolio webpage using HTML and CSS.
In my code, when you:

```
load my portfolio
THEN you're  presented with my  name, a recent avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me
WHEN you click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN you click on the link to the section about my work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN you are presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN you click on the images of the applications
THEN you are taken to that deployed application
WHEN you resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN you are presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

The following is my deployed website:
https://ertonal.github.io/Portfolio-Page_2/

## Usage

Use my website as a template for a portfolio
